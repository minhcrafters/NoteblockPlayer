**hhhzzzsss**: Original author

**Ayunami2000**: Came up with the concept of directly placing noteblocks with nbt data instead of manually tuning them.

**Sk8kman**: Several of Songplayer 3.0's changes were inspired by their fork of SongPlayer. Most notably was their alternate stage designs, but it also motivated me to implement playlists and togglable movements.

**Lizard16**: Cited by Sk8kman as the person who made the spherical stage design.
